Project 2
========


The cript I created is written in BASH which is the native shell language of linux machines. I wrote this on 
a Windows computer and so it is meant to be run on a windows computer. This script will show you three basic system informations.
The steps below will guide you on how to run the command on your windows machine.
If you do not want to follow my instructions there is a video you may watch as well that may help you:

First you will want to go to this website
```html
     https://www.cygwin.com/
```
In the top left you will want to click the button that says "Install Cygwin". This will take you to a page with a x64 and an x32 bit download.
Chose the correct option for you, then download and run the exe file. You will want to click
```
     Install from Internet
```
On the next page you will want to click
```
     All Users
```
And assign a root directory if you dont like the default directory
Then click
