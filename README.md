Project 3
========


My python program uses an API called gTTS (google text to speech) so first download this:

```python3
pip install gTTS
```

Once that is installed download my program under Labs>Project3 and place it into a folder.
I recommend placing it into its own folder because it will add files to the folder the program is stored in.
Once you have this, run the program by double clicking on it or open cmd, navigate to the file and type:

```Python
python Text2Speech.py
```
