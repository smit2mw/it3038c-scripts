Project 2
========


The cript I created is written in BASH which is the native shell language of linux machines. I wrote this on 
a Windows computer and so it is meant to be run on a windows computer. This script will show you three basic system informations.
The steps below will guide you on how to run the command on your windows machine.
If you do not want to follow my instructions there is a video you may watch as well that may help you:

```

First you will want to go to this website
```html
     https://www.cygwin.com/
```
In the top left you will want to click the button that says "Install Cygwin". This will take you to a page with a x64 and an x32 bit download.
Chose the correct option for you, then download and run the exe file. You will want to click
```
     Install from Internet
```
On the next page you will want to click
```
     All Users
```
And assign a root directory if you dont like the default directory
Then click
```
     Use System Proxy Settings
```
There will be a list of mirror sites to download from and you make pick anyone that you want it does not matter.
Then there will be a list of packages to install. you want to find the package called "Base" which should have 37 items in it.
Click the drop down arrow and select "install"
Once this is done installing you will have something called "cygwin terminal" on your computer this will be where you can run my script (which is in Labs)
You will run my script with: (assuming you are in the folder you saved it in)
```Shell
     Bash Project2.sh
```
If you want to be able to summon bash in your cmd or powershell you can watch the rest of the video and it will explain how to do that (start at 5:52)
