Lab 7
========


I created a Python3 script and stored in it folder Labs. The script is called Pillow1.py
Assuming you already have Python3 installed you must run these commands:
```powershell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```
Once you have downloaded my script you can use the following command to run it:
```python
Pillow1.py
```
This script will promt you for the exact 
```javascript
JavaScript code block to highlight whats up in my code
```
